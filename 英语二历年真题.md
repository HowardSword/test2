The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003.At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare McAndrew， founder of Arts Economics, a research firm -- double the figure five years earlier.Since then it may have come down to $50 billion.But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos , greed  , passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries.

In the weeks and months that followed Mr.Hirst's sale , spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable.In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms.Sales of comtemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector, they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008.Within weeks the world's two biggest auction houses , sotheby's and Christie's , had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them.

The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989.This time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, through some have been far more fluctuant.But Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, says: "I'm pretty confident we're at the bottom"

the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989   在20世纪80年代，日本经济经历了一个繁荣时期，被称为“泡沫经济”。在这个时期，日本投资者和收藏家对艺术品的购买力和兴趣都很高。特别是对于印象派艺术品，日本人的购买力和需求一度推动了市场的繁荣。然而，随着泡沫经济的破裂，日本经济陷入了严重的衰退。在这个时期，许多日本投资者和收藏家不再有能力或兴趣购买昂贵的艺术品，包括印象派作品。因此，这个事件被描述为日本人停止购买印象派艺术品的历史事件。

What makes this slump different from the last , he says, is that there are still buyers in the market.Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell.The three Ds--death, debt and divorce --still deliver works of art to the market.But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room --- a women's group that had invited men to join them.Throughout the evening , one man had been particularly talkative, frequently  offering ideas and anecdotes, while his wife sat silently beside hime on the couch .Toward the end of evening, I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them.This man quickly nodded in agreenment.He gestured toward his wife and said, "She is the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and hurt." It' true, " he explained."When I come home from work I have nothing to say.If she didn't keep the converssation going we would spend the whole evening in silence."

This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in publlic situations, they often talk less at home.And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.

irony  n.可笑之处，  讽刺之处
pattern   模式  
wreaking 制造影响  施加影响
havoc  灾难 混乱 
wreaking havoc with 严重影响  严重扰乱



The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s.Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book Divorce Talk that most of the women she interviewed--but only a few of the men -- gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent, that amounts to millions of cases in the United Sates every year--a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.

gave ...as the reason for... 把...作为...的原因
lack of communication  缺乏沟通
divorces 离婚

amount  n.数量 金额  v.达到 总计 意味着  
that amounts to 这意味着
millions of cases 数百万的病例
epidemic  传染病   
virtual epidemic 虚拟的传染病


In my own research, complains from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his ， or doing far more than their share of daily life-support work like cleaning , cooking and social arrangements.Instead, they focused on communication: "He doesn't listen to me ." "He doesn't talk to me ." I found , as Hacker observed years befor , that most wives want their husbands to be , first and foremost , conversational partners, but few husbands share this expectation for their wives.

complains 抱怨
complains form women about their husbands 来自女人对丈夫的抱怨
tangible  adj.明确的  可感知到的
inequities  n.不公平待遇  不公平
tangible ineuites  可感知的不公平 （例如不尊重女性职业发展，不做家务）
given up  放弃
the chance for a career 职业机会
accompany  陪伴  
having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his 
    这里指 放弃了自己的职业机会而为了丈夫的职业机会选择去陪伴
share 分享 共享  还有一个  份额 股份  
share of daily  每日份额
support  支持 鼓励  帮助  维持  支撑 
life-support  日常生活的

share this expectation of his wife. 对他的妻子抱有这个期望


In short, the image that best represents the current crises is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it , wanting to talk.

"reveal" 和 "indicate" 都是表示揭示或指示的动词，但在使用上有一些细微的差别。

"reveal" 意味着揭示、展示或透露某事物，通常指的是将之前未知或隐藏的信息、真相或事实公之于众。它强调的是将某事物从隐藏状态中暴露出来，使其为他人所知。例如：

- The detective revealed the identity of the killer.(侦探揭示了凶手的身份。)
- The document revealed the company's financial troubles.(文件揭示了公司的财务困境。)

"indicate" 则意味着指示、表明或暗示某事物，通常指的是通过某种迹象、证据或符号来显示或暗示某种信息或情况。它强调的是通过某种方式来传达或表达某种含义。例如：

- The dark clouds indicate that it might rain soon.(乌云表明可能很快就会下雨。)
- His behavior indicates that he is not happy with the situation.(他的行为表明他对这种情况不满意。)

总的来说，"reveal" 更强调将隐藏的信息公之于众，而 "indicate" 则更强调通过某种迹象或符号来显示或暗示某种信息。

"effect" 强调的是因果关系，即某个因素导致了某个结果。例如：

- The new policy had a positive effect on the company's profits.(新政策对公司的利润产生了积极的影响。)
- Lack of sleep can have negative effects on your health.(睡眠不足可能对健康产生负面影响。)

"impact" 指的是对某个系统、群体或个人产生的深远影响。例如：

- The new technology had a significant impact on the way we communicate.(新技术对我们的沟通方式产生了重大影响。)
- The natural disaster had a devastating impact on the local community.(自然灾害对当地社区造成了毁灭性的影响。)

A few decades age, many people didn't drink water outside of a meal.Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long.Chewing gum, once bought primarily adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleaner for use after a meal.

Many Americans regard the jury as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries ; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin;

that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy.In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves ,rather than electing representatives to govern for them.

But as recently as in 1968, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals . In some states, for example , jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character.Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v.West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.

The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century.Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty.Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list.This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.

In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury.This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decison Taylor v.Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level.The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered to use the same procedures for selection male and demale jurors.

Copying Birds May Save Aircraft Fuel

Both Boeing and Airbus have trumpeted the efficiency of their newest aircraft, the 787 and A350 respectively.Their clever designs and lightweight composites certainly make a difference.But a group of researchers at Stanford University, led by Ilan Kroo, has suggested that airlines could take a more naturalistic approach to cutting jet-fuel use, and it would not require them to buy new aircraft.

The answer, says Dr.Kroo, lies with birds.Since 1914, scientists have known that birds flying in formation ---- a V-shape-----expend less energy.The air flowing over a bird's wings curls upwards behind the wingtips, a phenomenon known as upwash.Other birds flying in the upwash experience reduced drag, and spend less energy propelling themselves.Peter Lissaman , an aeronautics expert who was formerly at Caltech and the University of Southern California, has suggested that a formation of 25 birds might enjoy a range increase of 71%.

When applied to aircraft, the principles are not substantially different.Dr.Kroo and his team modelled what would happen if three passenger jets departing from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas were to assemble over Utah, assume an inverted V-formation, occasionally change places so all could have a turn in the most favourable positions , and proceed to  London.They found that the aircraft consumed as much as 15% less fuel (coupled with a reduction in carbon-dioxide output).Nitrogen-oxide emissions during the cruising portions of the flight fell by a around a quarter.

There are , of course , knots to be worked out .One consideration is safety, or at least the perception of it.Would passengers feel comfortable travelling in companion? Dr.Kroo points out that the aircraft could be separated by several nautical miles , and would not be in the intimate groupings favoured by display teams like the Red Arrows.A passenger peering out of window might not even see the other planes.

Whether the separation distances involved would satisfy air-traffic-control regulations is another matter, although a working group at the International Civil Aviation Organisation has included the possibility of formation flying in a blueprint for new operational guidelines.

It remains to be seen how weather conditions affect the air flows that make formation flight more efficient.In zones of increased turbulence , the planes' wakes will decay more quickly and the effect will diminish.Dr.Kroo says this is one of the areas his team will investigate further. It might also be hard for airlines to coordinate the departure times and destinations of passenger aircraft in a way that would allow them to gain from formation flight.Cargo aircraft, in contrast, might be easier to reschedule , as might routine military flights.

As it happens, America's armed forces are on theon case already.Earlier this year the country's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency announced plans to pay Boeing to investigate formation flight , though the programme has yet to begin.There are reports that some military aircraft flew in formation when they were low on fuel during the Second World War, but Dr.Lissaman says they are unsubstantiated."My fater was an RAF pilot and my cousin the skipper of a Lancaster lost over Berlin, " he adds.So he should know.

## Section 3 Translation
"Sustainability" has become a popular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal meaning.Having endured a painful period of unsustainability in his own life made it clear to hime that sustainability-oriented values must be expressed through everyday action and choice.

Ning recalls spending a confusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance.He'd been through the dot-com boom and burst and , desperate for a job, signed on with a Boulder agency.

It didn't go well ."It was a really bad move because that's not my passion," says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales."I was miserable, I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling.I had no money and needed the job.Everyone said 'Just wait , you'll turn the corner, give it some time.'"

The given chart illustrates the trend of mobile-phone subscriptions in both developed and developing countries from 2000 to 2008.Over this period, subscriptions in developing countries saw a significant surge from 0.5 billion to 3.9 billion.This represents an almost eight-fold increase.Conversely, in developed countries, the growth was more sluggish, moving from 0.6 billion to 0.68 billion, an increase of just over 10%.

The data indicates a digital leap in developing nations, possibly driven by the increased affordability of mobile technology and the expanding telecommunications infrastructure.This could be a reflection of economic growth and a growing middle class in these regions.

In contrast, the marginal growth in developed countries could be attributed to market saturation, where most of the population already owns a mobile phone, allowing for only incremental growth.This stark difference between the developed and developing nations highlights the dynamic nature of global technology adoption and emphasizes the role of economic conditions and market maturity in shaping these trends.

RutheSimmons joined Goldman Sachs's board as an outside director in January 2000; a year later she became president of Brown University.For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much criticism.But by the end of 2009 Ms.Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman's compensation committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked?  By February the next year Ms.Simmons had left the board.The position was just taking up too much time, she said.

Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm's board.Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive's proposals.If the sky, and the share price, is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises.

The researchers from Ohio University used a database that covered more than 10000 firms and more than 64000 different directors between 1989 and 2004.Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next.The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those "suprise" disappearances by directors under the age of 70.They found that after a surprise
departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increases by nearly 20%.The likelihood of being named in federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse.The effect tended to be larger for larger firms.Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship.Often they "trade up," leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.

But the researcher believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred.Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives.Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms.Simmons, once again very popular on campus.

Whatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemed near.The recession threatened to remove  the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet.Newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chronicling their own doom.America's Federal Trade Commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers.Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them? It will hold another meeting soon.But the discussions now seem out of date.

In much of the world there is little sign of crisis.German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession.Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled corner of the global industry, have not only survived but often returned to profit.Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.

It has not been much fun.Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard.The American Society of News Editors reckons that 13500 newroom jobs have gone since 2007.Readers are paying more for slimmer products.Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs.Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further.

Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers.American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads.Fully 87% of their revenues came form advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development.In Japan the proportion is 35%.Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.

The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspapers are least distinctive.Car and film reviewers have gone.So have science and general business reporters.Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off.Newspapers are less complete as a result.But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.

We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G.I.Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus.

But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more.During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combinatin with the postwar confidence in the future , made small, efficient housing positively stylish.

Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living.The phrase "less is more" was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II and took up posts at American architecture schools.These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course of American architecture, but none more so than Mies.

Mie's signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact than a lot.Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance.Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and laminated wood--materials that we take for granted today but that in the 1940s symbolized the future.Mies's sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient, rather than big and often empty.

signature  标志性的  惯有的

rather than 而不是


The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chiacgo's Lake Shore Drive, for example, were smaller--two--bedroom units under 1000 square feet--than those in their older neighbors along the city's Gold Coast.But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the view they afforded and the elegance of the buildings' details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time.

two bedroom  两居室
along  沿着
airy  通风的
afford 提供 给予
elegance n.优雅  elegant adj.优雅的
proportion  比例

The trend toward "less" was not entirely foreign.In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses----usually around 1200 square feet----than the spreading two-story ones he had designed in the 1890s and the early 20th century.

entirely adv.完全 全是
foreign  外国的
modest 谦逊的 低调的
efficient  高效的
spread  v.流传 传播
story 楼层   two story ones 两层楼


The "Case Study Houses" commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the "less is more" trend.Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing.In his Case Study House, Ralph Rapson may have mispredicted just how the mechanical revolution would impact everyday life--few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers--but his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.
